<h3 id="a-short-simple-guide--how-you-can-take-action"><em>A short, simple guide + how you can take action</em></h3>
<p>In the last few weeks, several <strong>Booth Level Officers (BLOs)</strong> across India have died while working on the <strong>Special Intensive Revision (SIR)</strong> of voter lists.
Families, teachers’ groups, and unions say the <strong>workload, long hours, and tight deadlines</strong> may have contributed in some cases.
The Supreme Court has also stepped in and asked states to reduce the pressure by adding more staff.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> about politics.
This is about <strong>basic safety</strong> and making sure people doing field work are treated fairly.</p>
<p><a href="/take_action">Take Action Now!</a></p>
<h2 id="whats-going-wrong"><strong>What’s going wrong?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>BLOs have been given a <strong>very high amount of field work</strong> in a short time.</li>
<li>Many BLOs are <strong>teachers or staff with full-time jobs</strong>, making this load harder.</li>
<li>News reports from multiple states show <strong>stress, exhaustion, and avoidable harm</strong>.</li>
<li>Some states have already <strong>extended deadlines</strong>, but more action is needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a <strong>policy issue</strong>, not a party issue.
Better timelines and more staff can prevent future harm.</p>
<h2 id="why-your-action-matters"><strong>Why your action matters</strong></h2>
<p>Government bodies take issues seriously when <strong>regular citizens raise their voice</strong>.</p>
<p>A few dozen well-written complaints to the <strong>State Election Commission (SEC)</strong> can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>deadline extensions</li>
<li>safety instructions</li>
<li>extra staff</li>
<li>clearer rules for field work</li>
</ul>
<p>Your message can <strong>save lives</strong> by helping reduce unsafe pressure on workers.</p>

<h2 id="take-action-2-minutes"><strong>Take Action (2 minutes)</strong></h2>
<p><a href="/take_action">Take Action Now!</a></p>
<ul>
<li>a list of <strong>official SEC complaint links</strong> for every state</li>
<li>a <strong>ready-to-copy message</strong></li>
<li>simple steps for filing your complaint</li>
</ul>
<p>No signup. No data collection.
Just <strong>you</strong>, as a citizen, asking for safer working conditions.</p>
