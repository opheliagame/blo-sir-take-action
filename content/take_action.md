title: "Take Action: Ask for Safer Work Conditions for BLOs"
---

### _A simple 2–minute step to help protect people doing essential field work_

The quickest and most effective way to help is to **file a calm, polite complaint** on your **State Election Commission (SEC)** website.
You do this **as a citizen**, and it is completely legal and voluntary.

A few strong complaints from citizens can push the government to:

- extend unsafe deadlines
- add more staff
- reduce pressure on BLOs
- prevent future harm

Your voice makes a difference.

# **Step 2 — Choose the complaint section**

On your SEC website, look for:

- “**Public Grievance**”
- “**Citizen Services**”
- “**Submit Complaint**”
- “**Feedback**”

All states (should) have a place to submit concerns.

---

# **Step 3 — Copy this message (your complaint)**

You may simply copy, paste, and submit this:

---

## **Suggested Complaint Text (short + clear)**

```
Subject: Request to Reduce Work Pressure on BLOs During SIR

Message:
I am writing as a concerned citizen.
In recent weeks, several news reports from different states have shown that BLOs are facing very high workload and short deadlines during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process. Families and unions have also raised serious concerns about stress and safety.

I request the State Election Commission to please:

1. Extend SIR deadlines where needed,
2. Deploy additional staff to reduce pressure, and
3. Issue clear safety and workload guidelines for all BLOs.

This will help protect the people who are doing essential field work for our democracy.
Thank you for your attention and quick action.

```

---

# **Step 4 — Press Submit**

That’s it. You’re done.
It takes **less than two minutes**, but it helps create real pressure for safe, humane working conditions.

---

# **Why This Works**

Election officials take notice when:

- multiple people write in,
- the message is polite,
- the request is specific,
- the issue is about safety (not politics).

A small number of well-written citizen complaints can lead to **statewide changes**.

---

# **Share This Page**

Share this link with:

- friends
- colleagues
- teachers
- anyone who wants to help but doesn’t know how

Even **10–50 complaints** in a single state can push officials to act faster.
