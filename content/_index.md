# **BLO Deaths During Voter List Work — What You Need to Know**

### _A short, simple guide + how you can take action_

In the last few weeks, several **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)** across India have died while working on the **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of voter lists.
Families, teachers’ groups, and unions say the **workload, long hours, and tight deadlines** may have contributed in some cases.
The Supreme Court has also stepped in and asked states to reduce the pressure by adding more staff.

This is **not** about politics.
This is about **basic safety** and making sure people doing field work are treated fairly.

## **What’s going wrong?**

- BLOs have been given a **very high amount of field work** in a short time.
- Many BLOs are **teachers or staff with full-time jobs**, making this load harder.
- News reports from multiple states show **stress, exhaustion, and avoidable harm**.
- Some states have already **extended deadlines**, but more action is needed.

This is a **policy issue**, not a party issue.
Better timelines and more staff can prevent future harm.

## **Why your action matters**

Government bodies take issues seriously when **regular citizens raise their voice**.

A few dozen well-written complaints to the **State Election Commission (SEC)** can lead to:

- deadline extensions
- safety instructions
- extra staff
- clearer rules for field work

Your message can **save lives** by helping reduce unsafe pressure on workers.
